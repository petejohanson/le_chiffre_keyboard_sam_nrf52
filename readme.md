# DO NOT USE THIS YET

This is a fork of the awesome [Le Chiffre STM32 by Sporkus](https://github.com/sporkus/le_chiffre_keyboard_stm32/) refactored to
SAM L/D21 and a secondary nRF52805 BLE module that is COMPLETELY UNTESTED.

Don't print it, don't try it and ask why it doesn't work.

When it's ready and tested, this will be updated. Until then, just don't.
